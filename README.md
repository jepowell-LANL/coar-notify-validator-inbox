COAR-Notify Validator Inbox

Description
-----------
This is a tool for validating AS2/COAR-Notify messages that might be exchanged between repositories and various downstream services. Please see [COAR-Notify Protocol documentation](https://notify.coar-repositories.org/) for more information. It supports posting of messages conforming to the defined protocol in various rdf serializations via HTTP POST requests. Once a message is received and stored, the application's Web interface provides the ability for users to validate messages against a SHACL shape validation file. Validation will include diagnostic text if appropriate, and a visualization of the message and validation results.

More comprehensive documentation forthcoming. Please contact James Powell, jepowell@lanl.gov with any questions.
